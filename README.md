# Berllan Electricity

Analyzing electricity usage at Berllan.

## Overview

There are lots of sources of data:

- Historical grid import [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCIZAEUMGs1CT-ksBc2uK4Fi6W4vfuO5kdtoMf39j3w/edit#gid=0).
  - I took regular meter readings from 5/1/2021 (a month or so after moving back to Berllan) until we switched to Octopus
- Octopus Energy
  - Gives grid import readings for every half hour, but we only use daily here
  - API: https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/#consumption
  - Python library: https://github.com/markallanson/octopus-energy
- SolarEdge
  - How much energy was generated by Solar every day, since 23/03/2020
  - Uses the REST API
  - Web page: https://monitoring.solaredge.com/solaredge-web/p/site/1550593/#/dashboard
- ASHP readings
  - I took regular readings for ASHP usage (see spreadsheet above)
  - This is not automated, and I stopped doing it after a year
- Tesla Powerwall
  - New! Not integrated here - there is a way to downlaod data though...

I've written a Python script to combine all the data into a single dataframe.
The result can then be analysed in R, or viewed on a web page that uses Vega-Lite.

## Running

```shell
. venv/bin/activate
